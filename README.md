Using Jupyter to explore DPLA API and DPyLA code library
This project combined an assignment and a genuine personal interest! I wanted to take my new Python skills and learn 
how to work with library-land APIs. DPLA is well documented and has a simple authentication structure, so I started there.
The purpose is basically to illustrate that Jupyter Notebooks are great platforms not only to build API tutorials, but 
also to document your learning progress as you go. 
Next steps: explore how to make this more interactive, so a learner could use their own API key and play with both the
search terms and the fields.
